/**
 * @brief %MAX7219 and MAX7221 controller.
 *
 * This is a port of the Arduino [MAX7219 class](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MAX7219) to the ESP32.
 * We can attach multiple IC instances daisy chained together.  Each device has its own *address* with the
 * first device being 0 (the default).
 *
 * All the devices are in shutdown mode by default when we start.  Any devices that are to be used
 * must be taken out of shutdown mode with a call to:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * shutdown(false);
 * @endcode
 *
 * For a given configuration, we are likely going to work with the %MAX7219 as either an 8 digit
 * 7 segment LED driver or an 8x8 led matrix.  Working with the two styles have similarities and
 * distinctions.  For the 7 segment LED, we will typically use setDigit(), setChar() and
 * setNumber() to set digits while in the 8x8 led matrix, we will use setLed(), setRow()
 * and setColumn().
