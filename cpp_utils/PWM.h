/**
 * @brief A wrapper for ESP32 %PWM control.
 *
 * Pulse Width Modulation (%PWM) is known as "LEDC" in the ESP32.  It allows us to set a repeating
 * clock signal.  There are two aspects to the signal called the frequency and duty cycle.  The
 * frequency is how many times per second the signal repeats.  The duty cycle is how much of a single
 * period the output signal is high compared to low.  For example, a duty cycle of 0% means that the signal
 * is always low, while a duty cycle of 100% means the signal is always high.  A duty cycle of 50% means
 * that the signal is high for 50% of the output and low for the remaining 50%.
